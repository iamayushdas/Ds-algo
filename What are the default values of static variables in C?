In C, if an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly, then:
— if it has pointer type, it is initialized to a NULL pointer;
— if it has arithmetic type, it is initialized to (positive or unsigned) zero;
— if it is an aggregate, every member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules;
— if it is a union, the first named member is initialized (recursively) according to these rules.

For example, following program prints:
Value of g = 0
Value of sg = 0
Value of s = 0

#include<stdio.h> 
int g;  //g = 0, global objects have static storage duration 
static int gs; //gs = 0, global static objects have static storage duration 
int main() 
{ 
  static int s; //s = 0, static objects have static storage duration 
  printf("Value of g = %d", g); 
  printf("\nValue of gs = %d", gs); 
  printf("\nValue of s = %d", s); 
  
  getchar(); 
  return 0; 
}
