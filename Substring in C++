In C++, std::substr() is a predefined function used for string handling. string.h is the header file required for string functions.

This function takes two values pos and len as an argument and returns a newly constructed string object with its value initialized to a copy of a sub-string of this object. Copying of string start from pos and done till pos+len means [pos, pos+len).

Important points:

The index of the first character is 0 (not 1).
If pos is equal to the string length, the function returns an empty string.
If pos is greater than the string length, it throws out_of_range. If this happen, there are no changes in the string.
If for the requested sub-string len is greater than size of string, then returned sub-string is [pos, size()).
Syntax:

string substr (size_t pos, size_t len) const;
Parameters:
pos: Position of the first character to be copied.
len: Length of the sub-string.
size_t: It is an unsigned integral type.

Return value: It returns a string object.

// CPP program to illustrate substr() 
#include <string.h> 
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
int main() 
{ 
    // Take any string 
    string s1 = "Geeks"; 
  
    // Copy three characters of s1 (starting  
    // from position 1) 
    string r = s1.substr(1, 3); 
  
    // prints the result 
    cout << "String is: " << r; 
  
    return 0; 
} 
Output:



String is: eek
